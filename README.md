# jQueryValidationDemo

This is a small working demo of how jQuery Validation can be used in forms.
This repository contains
- PHP code for connection to mySql database
- Form submission code
- jQuery Validation for form submission
- File upload code
- View results (This is independent of column names, hence can generalized for any database)

Have fun..!
